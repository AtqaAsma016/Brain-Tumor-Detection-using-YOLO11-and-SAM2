# Brain Tumor Detection using YOLOv11 and SAM

![Demo](assets/demo.gif) *(Example detection + segmentation output)*

A deep learning pipeline for detecting and segmenting brain tumors from MRI scans using:
- **YOLOv11** for tumor detection
- **Segment Anything Model (SAM)** for precise tumor segmentation

## Features
-  High-accuracy tumor detection with YOLOv11
-  Pixel-perfect segmentation with SAM
-  Optimized for both research and clinical applications
-  Supports batch processing for multiple MRI scans

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- NVIDIA GPU (recommended) with CUDA 11.7+
